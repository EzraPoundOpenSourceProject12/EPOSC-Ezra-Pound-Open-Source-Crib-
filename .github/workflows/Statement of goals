Statement of Goals:
      

  1.  To break up Ezra Pound's work into Aristotelian categories
  2.  To compile all relevant sources on Ezra Pound's work:
              Pound's definition of relevancy in criticism is something that talks about specific parts of Pound's work
              and only mention biographical particulars when necessary.
  3.  To create a compilation of various beginners guides for the Cantos to create a definitive one.
  4.  To compile an influence chart on those who attended "Ezuversity" and their peers:
              -To compile a list of modern authors who are in part or influenced by Pound
  5.  To compile lists of social/artistic movements inspired by Pounds Work
  6.  To create a genealogy of New Criticism that ultimately stems from Pound
  7.  To create a work that compiles all previous issues of Pound scholarship journals and abridges them
  8.  To create a genealogy of Pound's metahistory in relationship to Spengler, Junger, Heidegger, Toynbee and with a definitive conclusion on Frobenius's Padieuma
  9.  To align all of Pound's criticism within a Padieuma for the prospective individual man with a manifesto 
  10. Have it all be organized within Pound's aesthetic goals and tendencies ( Guide to Kulchur, Graphical design)
  11. To compile this into one complete unitary work with annotations of all of every canto hyperlinked to Pound's earlier work
  
  Rough Draft due date: 30, October 2025 Pound's 140th Birthday
